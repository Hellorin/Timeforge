A lightweight work hours tracker PWA built with React and Vite. Track your daily check-ins and check-outs, review your history, manage holiday allowance, and monitor your work/life health — all stored locally in your browser.

## Features

### Track
- **Check in / Check out** — One-tap time tracking for the current day
- **Live timer** — Real-time display of elapsed time for the active session
- **Today's summary** — Aggregated hours for all sessions in the current day, with a decimal/h:mm display toggle
- **History list** — Chronological log of past working days with total hours
- **Days off & weekend awareness** — Check-in is disabled on weekends and manually marked days off
- **Weekly progress indicator** — Current week total is highlighted in green when you're on track based on days elapsed
- **Milestone celebrations** — Confetti animation and a brief overlay card when you hit your daily (8 h) or prorated weekly target

### Calendar
- **Monthly overview** of logged days, with bulk day-off marking
- **Day edit modal** — Edit or delete individual sessions for any past day

### Holiday
- **Holiday balance card** — Days available, used, and accrued so far this year
- **Accrual modes** — Track allowance as accruing gradually through the year or available all at once
- **Prorated allowance** — Automatically adjusts for an employment start date mid-year
- **Year-end projection** — Warns if planned + used days off will exceed your annual allowance
- **Holiday chart** — Earned vs. used days off over the year

### Health
- **Health status card** — At-a-glance signal for whether your recent hours are on track, too high, or too low
- **Cumulative overtime chart** — Running total of over/under time relative to your weekly target
- **Recent weeks breakdown** — Hours vs. target for each of the last several weeks

### Platform
- **Offline-first PWA** — Installable on any device, works without internet
- **Local storage** — No backend, no account — data stays on your device
